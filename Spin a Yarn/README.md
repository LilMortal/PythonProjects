## 🗂️ File Structure

```
your-project-directory/
│
├── main.py                 # Main application file
├── README.md              # This documentation
└── saved_stories.json     # Generated when you save stories
```

## 💾 Data Storage

The application automatically creates a `saved_stories.json` file to store your stories locally. This file contains:
- Story timestamp
- Character name and genre
- Complete story text
- Story elements used

## 🧪 Testing

The application includes basic unit tests to verify core functionality:

```python
def run_tests():
    # Tests story generator initialization
    # Tests random element generation
    # Tests story generation with sample input
```

To run tests, uncomment the `run_tests()` line in the main section.

## 🌐 Converting to Web/GUI Version

### Web Version (Flask/Django)
- Replace command-line input with HTML forms
- Use templates to display stories with better formatting
- Add user authentication for personal story libraries
- Implement story sharing features

### GUI Version (Tkinter/PyQt)
- Create input forms with dropdowns and text fields
- Add story display with rich text formatting
- Include story export options (PDF, Word)
- Add story illustration capabilities

### Suggested Enhancements for Web/GUI:
```python
# Web framework example structure
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('story_form.html')

@app.route('/generate', methods=['POST'])
def generate():
    # Use existing StoryGenerator logic
    # Return rendered story template
```

## 🚀 Future Improvements
