## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Python is not recognized"**
- Make sure Python is installed and added to your system PATH
- Try using `python3` instead of `python`

**"Permission denied"**
- Make sure you have read permissions for the script file
- On Unix systems, you might need to make the file executable: `chmod +x mad_libs.py`

**"KeyboardInterrupt"**
- This occurs when you press Ctrl+C to exit - this is normal behavior

### Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Empty input validation
- Keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C)
- Unexpected errors with user-friendly messages
