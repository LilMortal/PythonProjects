## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: "Invalid email address" for valid-looking emails**
- A: The regex pattern is strict. Ensure no spaces, proper @ symbol placement, and valid TLD.

**Q: Application crashes on startup**
- A: Ensure you're using Python 3.10+. Check with `python3 --version`

**Q: Special characters not displaying correctly**
- A: Ensure your terminal supports UTF-8 encoding for emoji display.

**Q: Batch processing is slow**
- A: For very large lists (1000+ emails), consider processing in smaller chunks.
