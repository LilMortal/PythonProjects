## üé® Converting to GUI or Web Version

### GUI Version with tkinter

To create a GUI version, you could:

1. **Replace the command loop** with tkinter widgets:
   ```python
   import tkinter as tk
   from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox
   
   class MusicPlayerGUI:
       def __init__(self):
           self.root = tk.Tk()
           self.player = MusicPlayer()
           self.create_widgets()
   ```

2. **Add visual controls**:
   - Play/Pause/Stop buttons
   - Progress bar for current song
   - Volume slider
   - Playlist display with scrollbar

### Web Version with Flask

For a web interface:

1. **Create Flask routes** for each player action:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify
   
   app = Flask(__name__)
   player = MusicPlayer()
   
   @app.route('/play', methods=['POST'])
   def play_song():
       player.play_current()
       return jsonify({'status': 'playing'})
   ```

2. **Add HTML templates** with JavaScript for real-time updates
3. **Use WebSocket** for live playback status updates
