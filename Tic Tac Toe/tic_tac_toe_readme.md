## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python Version**: Python 3.7 or higher
- **Operating System**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Dependencies**: None (uses only Python standard library)

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the game file**:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Download directly
   curl -O https://example.com/main.py
   
   # Option 2: Clone if part of a repository
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```

2. **Verify Python installation**:
   ```bash
   python --version
   # or
   python3 --version
   ```

3. **Make the file executable** (optional, for Unix-like systems):
   ```bash
   chmod +x main.py
   ```

## üöÄ How to Run

### Basic Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

Or on some systems:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Running Tests

To run the built-in unit tests:

```bash
python main.py --test
```

### Direct Execution (Unix-like systems)

If you made the file executable:

```bash
./main.py
```

## üéØ Example Usage

### Starting the Game

When you run the program, you'll see the main menu:

```
üéÆ TIC TAC TOE GAME
====================
1. Player vs Player
2. Player vs AI
3. View Statistics
4. How to Play
5. Quit

Select an option (1-5):
```

### Game Board Display

The game board is displayed with clear coordinates:

```
   0   1   2
0  X |   | O
  -----------
1    | X |  
  -----------
2  O |   |  
```

### Making Moves

Players can input moves in several formats:
- `1,2` (comma-separated)
- `1 2` (space-separated)
- `12` (concatenated)

Example gameplay:
```
Player X, enter your move (row,col) or 'q' to quit: 1,1

   0   1   2
0    |   |  
  -----------
1    | X |  
  -----------
2    |   |  

AI is thinking...
AI plays: 0,0

   0   1   2
0  O |   |  
  -----------
1    | X |  
  -----------
2    |   |  
```

### Game Statistics

After playing several games:

```
üìä Game Statistics:
Player X wins: 3
Player O wins: 2
Draws: 1
Total games played: 6
```

## üéÆ Game Rules

1. **Objective**: Be the first player to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
2. **Players**: X always goes first
3. **Board**: 3√ó3 grid with positions numbered 0-2 for both rows and columns
4. **Winning**: Get three X's or O's in a row, column, or diagonal
5. **Draw**: If all 9 spaces are filled without a winner, the game is a draw

## ü§ñ AI Features

The AI opponent includes several advanced features:

- **Minimax Algorithm**: Uses game theory to make optimal moves
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes decision-making speed
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard (currently set to Hard)
- **Strategic Play**: The AI will always block winning moves and take wins when available

## üß™ Testing

The game includes built-in unit tests that verify:

- Board initialization
- Move validation
- Win detection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Draw detection
- Game state management

Run tests with: `python main.py --test`

## üîß Code Structure

The project is organized using object-oriented programming principles:

- **TicTacToe Class**: Main game logic and state management
- **Game Logic Methods**: Move validation, win detection, board management
- **AI Methods**: Minimax algorithm implementation
- **User Interface Methods**: Menu system, input handling, display functions
- **Utility Functions**: Testing, statistics, helper methods

## üöÄ Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements

1. **GUI Version**: Convert to a graphical interface using tkinter, pygame, or web-based
2. **Network Play**: Add multiplayer support over network
3. **Difficulty Levels**: Implement multiple AI difficulty settings
4. **Game Variants**: Add different board sizes (4√ó4, 5√ó5)
5. **Save/Load**: Implement game state persistence
6. **Themes**: Add visual themes and customization options
7. **Sound Effects**: Add audio feedback for moves and wins
8. **Tournament Mode**: Implement bracket-style tournaments
9. **Move History**: Track and display move history
10. **Undo Feature**: Allow players to undo recent moves

### Converting to GUI

To convert this to a GUI application, consider:

**Using tkinter (built-in)**:
```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox

class TicTacToeGUI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        self.root.title("Tic Tac Toe")
        self.buttons = []
        # ... implement GUI logic
```

**Using pygame**:
```python
import pygame
import sys

class TicTacToeGame:
    def __init__(self):
        pygame.init()
        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((300, 300))
        # ... implement game loop
```

**Web-based with Flask**:
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('game.html')
```
