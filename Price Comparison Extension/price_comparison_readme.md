## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Could not extract price from URL"**
- The website might be blocking requests
- Try increasing the delay with `--delay 3`
- Check if the URL is accessible in your browser

**"Error fetching URL"**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the URL is correct and accessible
- Some sites may require specific headers

**"No products found for comparison"**
- Ensure URLs are valid product pages
- Try the demo mode first: `python main.py --demo`
- Check that products have visible prices

### Getting Help
1. Run `python main.py --help` for usage information
2. Try demo mode to verify installation: `python main.py --demo`
3. Check Python version: `python --version` (requires 3.8+)
4. Verify internet connectivity
